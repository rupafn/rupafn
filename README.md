- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fajilatun
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data to create an impact on our lifestyle
- ðŸŒ± Technology is always evolving to improve our lives and I am always trying to keep up by gaining new information from the internet.
- ðŸŒ± Not only that, but I always try to implement the things I learn and hence my Github profile.
- ðŸŒ± Lately I have been working on some Data Science projects and [here](https://github.com/rupafn/DS-Porfolio) is the link to the repository called [DS-Portfolio](https://github.com/rupafn/DS-Porfolio)
- ðŸ“« Please feel free to look around my Github profile
